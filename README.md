# f1data
Data cleaning and visualisation using F1 laptime data

This is a jupyter notebook built to extract the data from the F1 PDF tables, and write that to CSV whilst holding all the relevant info like like pitlaps (marked with a P)
It then writes that to a CSV in case you want to use it later, and processes it using matplotlib to spit out an animated gif using laptimes, but you could definitely ask it to create different graphs of the data in different formats. Mostly it's just a useful PDF data scraper, although driver names currently need to be hard coded for this to work. 

Enjoy!
